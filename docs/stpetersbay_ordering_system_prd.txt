🏝️ St. Peter’s Bay Ordering System – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Client: St. Peter’s Bay Resort, Barbados
Prepared by: Thomas Knight
Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.2

🧭 Executive Summary

St. Peter’s Bay Resort aims to elevate its guest experience by introducing a digital Beach and Room Service Ordering System. Guests will be able to order drinks and food directly from their mobile devices by scanning a QR code or visiting a short resort URL.

The system will display two clear options — Beach Drinks and Room Service Food — allowing guests to browse menus, customize items, and submit orders seamlessly. Orders will appear instantly on a Kitchen Dashboard, where staff can confirm receipt, manage preparation, and mark items complete.

The backend menu and pricing data will be easily editable by non-technical resort staff, ensuring full operational control without developer involvement. Orders remain visible on the kitchen screen until marked completed to eliminate missed requests.

This project will enhance efficiency, reduce wait times, and create a modern, frictionless ordering experience that aligns with St. Peter’s Bay’s reputation for luxury hospitality.
