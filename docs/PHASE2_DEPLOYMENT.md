## 🎯 What's New in Phase 2

Phase 2 introduces **real-time order synchronization** using Firebase Firestore, replacing the local-only localStorage system from Phase 1.

### Key Features Implemented:
1. ✅ Orders saved to Firestore database (cloud-based)
2. ✅ Real-time dashboard updates (no more 5-second polling)
3. ✅ Orders sync instantly between guest page and kitchen dashboard
4. ✅ Persistent order storage (survives page refreshes)
5. ✅ Foundation for Phase 3 Admin CMS

## 🔧 Firebase Setup Required

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Security Rules

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **St Peters Bay Food Ordering**
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** in the left menu
4. Click on the **Rules** tab
5. Copy the contents of `firestore.rules` from your project
6. Paste into the Firebase Console rules editor
7. Click **Publish**

### Step 2: Verify Firestore is Enabled

1. In Firebase Console, go to **Firestore Database**
2. You should see "Cloud Firestore" with a database instance
3. If not, click **Create database** → Select **Start in test mode** → Choose location (us-east1 recommended)

### Step 3: Test Security Rules

The current rules allow:
- ✅ Anyone can CREATE orders (guests)
- ✅ Anyone can READ orders (dashboard)
- ✅ Anyone can UPDATE orders (dashboard status changes)
- ❌ No one can DELETE orders

**Important:** These are permissive rules for testing. For production, add Firebase Authentication and restrict dashboard access to authenticated staff only.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Local Testing (Recommended First)

1. **Start a Local Server**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Python
   cd "/Users/timnyem1mac/Desktop/SPB food ordering"
   python3 -m http.server 8000

   # Option 2: Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000

   # Option 3: VS Code Live Server extension
   # Right-click orderingsystem.html → Open with Live Server
   ```

2. **Open Two Browser Windows**
   - Window 1: http://localhost:8000/orderingsystem.html (Guest Page)
   - Window 2: http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html (Dashboard)

3. **Test Order Flow**
   - In Window 1 (Guest):
     - Select "Beach Drinks" or "Room Service"
     - Add items to cart
     - Add modifiers and notes
     - Fill out checkout form
     - Submit order

   - In Window 2 (Dashboard):
     - Order should appear **INSTANTLY** (no refresh needed!)
     - Verify all details are correct
     - Click "✅ Confirm Received"
     - Order should update status in real-time
     - Click "🗑️ Mark Completed"
     - Order should disappear from dashboard

4. **Verify Firestore**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
   - Click on "orders" collection
   - You should see your test orders with all data

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Orders appear on dashboard immediately after submission
- [ ] Multiple items with modifiers display correctly
- [ ] Custom notes appear on dashboard
- [ ] "Confirm Received" updates order status
- [ ] "Mark Completed" removes order from dashboard
- [ ] Completed orders still visible in Firestore with status="completed"
- [ ] Page refresh doesn't lose orders
- [ ] Filter buttons work (All, New, Confirmed, Beach, Room)
- [ ] Beach Drinks orders show correct location
- [ ] Room Service orders show correct room number

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment

### Current Hosting

The project is deployed on **Vercel** at https://spbgazebo.com with automatic Git deployments configured.

### Files Deployed

All project files are automatically deployed via Git push:

```
/orderingsystem.html
/dashboard.html
/scripts/firebase-config.js        ← NEW
/scripts/ordering_logic.js         ← MODIFIED
/scripts/dashboard_logic.js        ← MODIFIED
/data/sample_menu.json
/vercel.json                       ← Deployment configuration
```

### Optional Files (Not Required for Phase 2):
```
/migrate_menu.html                 ← Only if you want to store menu in Firestore
/firestore.rules                   ← Already deployed to Firebase Console
/docs/PHASE2_DEPLOYMENT.md         ← Documentation only
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   - Vercel automatically deploys from the connected Git repository
   - Every push to the main branch triggers a new deployment

2. **Manual Deployment (Optional):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```

3. **Vercel Configuration:**
   - Deployment config is in `vercel.json`
   - Root redirect: `/` → `/orderingsystem.html`
   - Domain: spbgazebo.com

4. **Test Live Site:**
   - Visit: https://spbgazebo.com/orderingsystem.html
   - Follow the same testing checklist as local testing above

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Current Setup (Phase 2 - Test Mode)
- Firestore is in **open mode** - anyone can read/write orders
- No authentication required
- Suitable for testing and low-risk environments
- Dashboard is accessible to anyone with the URL

### Recommended for Production (Phase 3+)
1. **Add Firebase Authentication**
   - Protect dashboard with login
   - Only authenticated staff can view/modify orders

2. **Update Firestore Rules**
   ```javascript
   // Example production rules
   match /orders/{orderId} {
     allow create: if true;  // Guests can still order
     allow read, update: if request.auth != null;  // Staff only
     allow delete: if false;
   }
   ```

3. **Add Password Protection to Dashboard**
   - Use Firebase Auth or simple password protection
   - Add in Phase 3 implementation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Orders not appearing on dashboard

**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12) → Check for errors
2. Verify Firebase config is correct in `firebase-config.js`
3. Check Firestore security rules are published
4. Verify both pages are served over HTTP/HTTPS (not file://)

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
2. Ensure rules match the `firestore.rules` file
3. Click "Publish" to apply changes
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation

### Issue: Real-time updates not working

**Check:**
1. Dashboard should show "Real-time listener setup complete" in console
2. Refresh the dashboard page
3. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
4. Verify you're not blocking WebSocket connections (firewall/proxy)

### Issue: Module loading errors

**Check:**
1. Files must be served via HTTP server (not file://)
2. Script tags have `type="module"` attribute
3. Import paths are correct (./scripts/firebase-config.js)

## 📊 Firestore Data Structure

### Orders Collection
```javascript
{
  // Document ID: auto-generated by Firestore
  menuType: "beachDrinks" | "roomService",
  name: "Guest Name",
  location: "Room 207" | "Main Beach - Center",
  items: [
    {
      itemName: "Mojito",
      price: 12,

  status: "new" | "confirmed" | "completed",
  timestamp: Firestore.Timestamp,
  confirmedAt: Firestore.Timestamp,      // Optional
  completedAt: Firestore.Timestamp       // Optional
}
